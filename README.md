## Motivation

The main motivation for this project is to provide a web-based editor for the StepCode language.
StepCode is a pseudo-code language for writing step-by-step instructions. It is designed to be easy to read and write,
and to be easily converted to other languages. It is based on the syntax
of [PSeInt](http://pseint.sourceforge.net/), a pseudo-code language for teaching programming.

## Development

To run the editor locally, you must first install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then, you can run the editor with the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server at `http://localhost:5173`.
